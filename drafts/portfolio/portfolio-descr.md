Extraordinary Travellers Club
------------------------------

### Requirements ###

Design a building with a concert hall for 300 people, lounges,
lobby, guest rooms and a restaurant for a fictious club. 
Invent the fictious club itself, it's name, character and specialization.

### Location ###

Russia, Moscow, 13 Sretenka st. - historical city centre. 

### Vision ###

The site is located at the very center of Moscow among historical buildings
of 17-19 century vintage. I wanted to blend the Clubhouse naturally
into the surroundings without creating a dissonance, but add a dash of new
look and feel to it.

I drew most of the inspiration from Chicago architecture and
Reform Club building in London.
Based on this vision I have chosen brick for exterior siding
to create a sense of long-term presense,
a next step in the evolution of the neighborhood.
I decided not to go taller then three stories to retain a
cozy atmosphere both inside and outside. A spacious atrium
and a winter garden create an interaction between the built space
and the outside world in line with the character of the Travellers' club.


### Software used ###

- AutoCad
- Revit
- Blender

Hunters Guest House
---------------------


### Requirements ###

Design a one-story house for temporary residence of a small group of hunters
or fishermen (up to 4 people). There should be a separate space
for storing outerwear and equipment in the entrance hallway.
The house should have a terrace or cold veranda. An optional
observation tower.

### Location ###

Central Russia

### Vision ###

My goal was to use as much natural materials as possible and at the same time
create a new twist to the usual hunters hut design common in these parts.
The style was inspired by works of Frank Lloyd Wright.

### Software used: ###

- AutoCad
- Photoshop


Park Bridge
-------------

2020

### Requirements ###

To design a pedestrian park bridge with a span of 15 meters and a height difference of 5 meters. 
The main requirement for this project was to create a design that conforms with the Building Code (SNIP).
Each flight of stairs can't be longer than 15 steps, all steps must be of equal height, etc.

### Vision ###

In this project I wanted to explore the ways of using laminated timber as a sustainable
alternative to steel and concrete. In order to comply with SNIP I had to do at least
one landing in the middle of the stairway.

Software:
AutoCad
Photoshop

Central Park Ensemble in Tblisi, Georgia
-----------------------------------------

2024

### Requirements ###

Create a park ensemble that includes:

- A Pavilion that can accomodate 200 people with integrated cafe;
- An 'amphitheatre' - a place where people can gather in groups and watch presentations, performances etc.;
- A space for children to play - more of creative sculpture installation type rather than a conventional playground.

### Location ###

Tbilisi Central Park used to be a hippodrome. Currently the area is unkempt.
People use it as a park and as a shortcut to the next district. The terrain is mostly flat and
there is vast amount of groundwater underneath it.

### Vision ###

All elements of the ensemble must fit into the existing path layout.
The pavillion must blend into the flat open environment;
be light and airy; create a peaceful presence.

=========

I decided to make the pavilion and the area around it a more semi-circular rather than
rectangular shape so that it:

- fits naturally into the flow of people;
- acts as an amphitheatre around a lawn that can be used as playground or for a fountain.

A slight slope the pavillion is built on allows for some 3-D elements: stairs,
a sloping pathway and a parapet to sit on, making the composition more interesting and engaging.
The structure is made of steel columns, lightweight wooden roof frame
covered with asphalt shingles.

The playground imitates hexagonal volcanic rock formations.

The small amphitheater sits 20 people. The hedge around it adds some privacy to it.

Shelters in Birtvisi Canyon, Georgia
--------------------------------------

2024

### The task ###

Create a set of small guest houses (shelters).
Every shelter should house 3-5 people.
Make shelters as small and simple as possible.
No electricity, no amenities required.
The shelters will be used by tourists visiting some wild areas of the country.
Find the wild area and fit the shelters into it.

### Location ###

Birtvisi Canyon, located 30 km to the south-west of Georgiaâ€™s capital,
is a national park famous for its medieval fortress and beautiful mountain sights.
There is a small wooded opening after the entrance to the canyon, where
visitors like to set up camps and do some rock climbing. Tourists love this place
and it's rarely empty, especially on weekends.
After visiting it a few times, I distinctly observed the need for more substantial housing.

=========

### Vision ###

It is quite hard to get to the canyon even on foot. Each element of the building structure
should be of manageable size and weight as it will be delivered either on foot or
by a donkey. Stone is available locally in small quantities.
That's why I chose wood as the main material.
The magic created by surrounding nature and my choice of materials made me think of japanese theme
for its organic blend with nature and exquisite use of wood. It also has an interesting
resemblance with traditional georgian architecture.

The key feature of the shelters is curved roofs. The roof consists of
long curved beams (about 7 m long) and straight beams across them.
There are two ways to construct long beams:

1. As a whole element made of laminated timber;
2. As a series of short elements made of straight pieces of dimensional lumber.

Considering the difficulties with delivery of long heavy timbers to the site,
I paid particular attention to the details of implementation of the second option
to make sure the roof will be structurally sound and simple to build.
